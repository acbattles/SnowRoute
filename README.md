# SnowRoute
My Insight Data Science Project

SnowRoute implements the predictions of an Extreme Gradient Boosting Classifier (XGBoost) trained on over 10,000 snow-related traffic accident records (Denver, CO) to predict the safety of driving routes in Denver.

The model was developed in Python, deployed in a Flask application on an AWS EC2 instance, and leverages the MapBox API, with prediction data stored on the server as a postGIS database.
